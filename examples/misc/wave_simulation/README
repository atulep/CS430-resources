Sequential wave program
-----------------------
The file slow_seq_wave.c contains a simple program of the wave simulation.
The file fast_seq_wave.c contains a more optimized version of the program
for wave simulation. To compile these programs copy them to your directory
and use the Makefile. Note, for fast_seq_wave.c you have to define the
constant DISPLAY to be 1, else the display code is not compiled. Or you
can define this constant in the Makefile.  The executables generated 
by the make are:

slow_wave
fast_wave
ghost_wave
ptr_wave

Note that ghost_wave and ptr_wave are both almost equally fast but ptr_wave is
much more complicated and I would not recommend using that as your basis for
the parallel program.

Note that the X Window display for ptr_wave will only work if you choose
the size of the grid to be no more than 1024. Otherwise, you will have
to change the constant MAX in ptr_seq_wave.c and recompile.



There are two different ways of displaying the wave. 

Dynamic display:
---------------
 Using the functions initwin(..) and display_once(..)  contained in this file
 you can dynamically display the wave in color on a X Windows display. 
 Check out the function create_bitmap() in fast_seq_wave.c. 
 Note that these functions will work properly only if the array data has 
 the same dimension as the second argument "size". If you are using malloc 
 to dynamically allocate the space, then there is no problem. Otherwise, 
 if you are using a two dimensional array then "size" must match the actual
 declared dimension. See inside file fast_seq_wave.c on how to use these
 functions. Also, if the color display doesn't seem right  try executing
 the command "xstdcmap -all" on your local workstation.

Static display:
--------------

Using the function pbmdump(..) contained in the file slow_seq_wave.c (and
med_seq_wave.c), you can write out a file in PBM format containing grey
code values corresponding to the data values of the wave function. This
file can be viewed by using the "gqview" command.  By default the name
of the PBM file is "dump.pbm". Then, you can use the command "gwenview
dump.pbm" to view the snapshot of the wave (or use some other program
to view images). This is the preferred method for viewing on slower
machines or if you want to time the computation without the graphics
but still want to check the results visually at the end.

Notes from Charles Paulson
--------------------------

I moved MAX from fast_sequential_wave.c to gldisplay.h, as I needed a static
buffer for communication between threads.

In addition to replacing the functions "initwin", and "display_once", I added
a function call to "closewin".

I made the window size dependant on the data size, because, it produced
strange results when I didn't (like checkerboard type patterns).
