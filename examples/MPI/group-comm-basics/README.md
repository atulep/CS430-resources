# Overview
Examples illustrate use of various group operations from MPI. The business logic is straightforward and simple. There is no real speedup from doing any of those programs in parallel. However, that's not the point. The goal is to show how to use MPI group operations.

# How to build
Do ```make```. Then you can run each of the examples with ```mpiexec``` command.
