How to run multiple jobs using the swarm utility:


List the sequential programs that you want to run in one file (one per
line). See the file "myjobs" in this folder for an example.

Then submit your jobs with the following command

swarm -f myjobs 

which creates PBS jobs and submits them. By default, swarm will run two
processes per node (assuming each node is a dual-processor) and create
one PBS job per node. So the output from the two commands will show up in the
output file corresponding to the PBS job generated by swarm.

If you like to get email when your jobs are done, then use:

swarm -f myjobs -m e

You may want to set up a .forward file on beowulf so that the email notification from
PBS gets routed to your favorite mail address.


If your program is I/O  or memory intensive, then you may want to tell swarm to
only run one process per node. This can be done as follows:


swarm -f myjobs -n 1 -m e

Check the status of your jobs with the following command.

qstat -a

To kill a job, use

qdel <job#>.beowulf

To kill all your jobs, use

qdelall
